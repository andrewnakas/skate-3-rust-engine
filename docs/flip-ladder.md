# Double, triple and quad flips, and the late flips

Measured 2026-09-21 with `crates/skate-game/src/tests/flip_playback.rs`, which drives the
production controller -> gesture recognizer -> ActionGraph -> MotionGraph -> physics -> scorer
path. Run it with:

```
SKATE3_ASSET_ROOT=C:/s3/installations/<install>/assets RUST_MIN_STACK=134217728 \
  cargo test -p skate-game --bin skate3rust flip_tests -- --ignored --nocapture
```

`RUST_MIN_STACK` is not optional: without it rustc itself dies with `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`
(0xc0000409) while building any `skate-game` bin test harness at `opt-level=3`.

## They already worked; the gate is air time, not recognition

The whole ladder is authored, and this port already walks all of it. A held kickflip publishes
`Kickflip` -> `Kickflip2` -> `Kickflip3` -> `Kickflip4` over `B_KICKFLIP_IN_A`, `_CYC1`, `_CYC2`,
`_CYC3`, `_OUT4`, and the landing is named `#ID_TRICK_FLIP_QUADRUPLE_KICKFLIP`. The heelflip does
the same over its own clips. So does the pre-existing playtest evidence:
`logs/launch-20260921-124517.err` already contains a `heelflip4` (scorable 134) off `B_HEELFLIP_CYC3`.

**The earlier premise -- "the graph probably does not recognise a triple" -- was wrong.** What
limits the count is the authored air-time gate:

| Authored state | Precondition | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `End.Out.Out1` | `not HasIntent <Trick>Hold` OR `TimeToLand < 0.525` OR `IsBodyFlipping` | ends at the single |
| `End.Out.Out2` | same, with `TimeToLand < 0.8` | ends at the double |
| `End.Out.Out3` | `not HasIntent <Trick>Hold` OR `IsBodyFlipping` | ends at the triple |

`Cyc1` lists `End.Out.Out2` *before* `Cyc2.StillDouble`, and both transitions share the same
`WillExpire` expression, so whenever `Out2`'s precondition passes the exit wins and the ladder
stops. Every step therefore needs the pop to still have the authored time left.

`TimeToLand` is `PhysOutAir.time_until_collision_184` = `collision_time_196 - time_in_state_180`
(`skate-core/src/air/known/output.rs`). `KnownAir` takes that prediction **once**, on entering the
air, and then only counts it down -- changing the world mid-air does not extend it. A stock flat-
ground pop leaves about 0.77 s, just under `Out2`'s 0.8 s, which is why a flat kickflip stops at
the double and why triples and quads only show up off a ledge or a ramp.

That also rules out one tempting test shortcut: dropping the ground out from under the skater
mid-air does nothing, because the prediction was already taken. The harness pops harder instead
(a vertical velocity boost on the takeoff frame) rather than rebuilding `BoardWorld`, which would
drop the canonical course's authored query metadata and fail with
`Canonical world has no authored query metadata`.

Measured thresholds on the flat course at 8 m/s, boost applied one tick before takeoff:

| Trick | boost reaching the quad | landed reward | landed name |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kickflip | 8 m/s | 497 | `#ID_TRICK_FLIP_QUADRUPLE_KICKFLIP` |
| Heelflip | 10 m/s | 564 | `#ID_TRICK_FLIP_QUADRUPLE_HEELFLIP` |
| Kickflip, flick released | - (single) | 336 | `#ID_TRICK_FLIP_KICKFLIP` |

The heelflip needs the taller pop because its authored clips are longer, not because anything is
broken.

## Late flips

`air.xml`'s `Lateflip` state and its `T_Lateflip.xml` leaves work too. An ollie followed by the
authored `skater_air.pat` scoop plays `B_LATE_KICKFLIP` / `B_LATE_HEELFLIP` and lands as
`#ID_TRICK_FLIP_LATE_KICKFLIP` / `#ID_TRICK_FLIP_LATE_HEELFLIP` (scorables 105 / 104). The
`L_*` gestures are deliberately absent from the 270-row trick mapping: they reach the MotionGraph
as bare intents and are matched by `HasIntent` in the authored state.

Note `input/gesture_input.rs::permitted`: actor flag bit 4 refuses every `L_*` gesture outright,
so late flips are unavailable in whichever difficulty sets it.

## The ladder converts, it does not accumulate

`conversions::LINKS` is the flip-count ladder (`93 -> 92`, `94 -> 93`, `134 -> 94`, and the
kickflip/nollie equivalents). `Runtime::carrier` converts the Air carrier instead of finishing it,
and `Carrier::convert_to` marks the previous carrier completed **with its reward discarded** and
credits the replacement immediately. So a quad banks the quad's authored 250, never 100+150+200+250.
`a_single_flip_is_the_ladder_baseline` pins that the quad still out-scores the single.

## Open: the class-3 one-shot flip bonus never fires in the live path

`SCORE_TRICK air ... bonus_paid=false` on **every** run above -- single, double, triple and quad,
kickflip and heelflip. `pay_flip_bonus` (82DA93D8, `reward += 4.0 * points * factor`) needs
`f.hips_ground` to be a hit that lies *between* the deck and the hips (`dot(deck-contact,
hips-contact) < 0`). On flat ground the hips-line hit is below both, so the dot is positive and the
bonus is skipped. The "kickflip 100 -> 500" figure recorded earlier came from
`examples/scoring_flow_data`, where that geometry is supplied synthetically; it has never been
observed live.

This is not specific to the ladder -- it is the same for a single flip -- so it was left alone here
rather than guessed at. Settling it needs the retail meaning of `PhysOut.Ground +144/+160/+192/+208`
confirmed against the binary: the port currently feeds the deck *body* position where 82DA93D8
reads `block[144]`, which the handplant work (`82DAB7D0`) suggests is the **deck downward probe**,
a probe `board_ground.rs` does not issue at all.

The Air collector's bank had no trace of its own until now; `SCORE_TRICK air ...` was added in
`Runtime::finish` so the next investigation does not have to infer the components from the total.

## Retail has no late double, triple or quad

Asked and settled 2026-09-23, so it does not get re-opened: the ladder and the late mechanic are
separate systems in retail and they do not compose. Three independent confirmations.

**The scorable table has no numbered late entries.** `scoring/catalog.rs` carries exactly six late
ids -- `latekickflip` (105), `lateheelflip` (104), `latebsshuv` (102), `latefsshuv` (103),
`latebackfootkickflip` (101), `latebackfootheelflip` (100) -- plus `lateflip_darkcatch` (331).
There is no `latekickflip2/3/4`, where the ordinary flips carry `kickflip2/3/4` at 97, 98 and 135.

**The conversion table confirms it.** `conversions::LINKS[100..=105]` is `(-1, 128)` for all six:
they link into `ollie`, not into a ladder chain. A late flip has no rung to be converted from.

**The authored state has no cycle.** `Tricks/T_Lateflip.xml` is a single state with one
`PlayAnimation` and two `WillExpire` exits. `T_Kickflip.xml` is what a ladder looks like -- the
`Cyc1`/`Cyc2`/`Cyc3` chain and the `End.Out.Out1..3` air-time gates above. `skater_air.pat`
authors exactly six patterns, `L_F_Kickflip`, `L_B_Kickflip`, `L_F_Heelflip`, `L_B_Heelflip`,
`L_FS_Shuvit` and `L_BS_Shuvit`, and no held or repeated variant of any of them.

Adding a late ladder is therefore not a port fix; it would be inventing a trick Skate 3 does not
have, and it would need scorable ids beyond the retail 332, new `LINKS` rows and new clips.
