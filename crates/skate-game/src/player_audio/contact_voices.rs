//! The Contacts component's one-shot bank voices: wheel pops and the landing impact.
//!
//! `ContactsOwner` decides *when* a contact sound plays (the retail edges and selector ladders) but
//! cannot reach the runtime from [`ContactVoices`], so it records its plays here and the worker
//! drains them: the request's selector and the audio state pick a Splice bank sample
//! (`skate_data::audio::splice`), the sample resolves to its layered members, and each member is
//! opened as a one-shot voice (`AuthoredRuntime::play_oneshot`). One retail voice is therefore a
//! set of handles, held and freed together the way `sub_824836B8` frees the container's children.
//!
//! `ContactSound::GrindOnset` takes a different route. Retail's `sub_824BB0E0` does not start a
//! bank voice at all: it posts a 48-byte message to the contact-sound manager at `[manager+668]`,
//! which is `CSTATEMGR_Collision`. That subsystem is [`super::collision_states`], and
//! [`ContactVoicePlayer::post_grind_onset`] drives it — the message resolves to up to two voices,
//! one per material, each chosen against the *other* material's class.
//!
//! Still not routed here: `ContactSound::PopRoll`. The rolling/scrape contacts are
//! `sub_824BC188`'s own path and the pop-roll layer's bank is not resolved by the ported
//! selection, so it is dropped with a label rather than played from an invented sample.

/// voice and the two contact-sound-manager collision voices joined it — and the stack clips:
/// measured over a playtest, every landing peaked at exactly 1.0, 271 output blocks at full scale.
/// Clipping is a hard limiter, so it flattened class 0, 1 and 2 to the same loudness however well
/// the classes were resolved. That is what "every landing sounds equally loud" was.

/// Retail's own class-0 landings sit at **−4.4 dBFS** and do not clip (its class 2 reaches +2.0 and
/// just touches the ceiling), measured from `.local/captures/retail-levels-*.log` binned by
/// retail's class thresholds. This trim exists to put class 0 back below the ceiling so the
/// authored class step — +4.7 dB at class 1 and +5.8 dB at class 2, which is in the samples' own
/// layer counts and gains — survives to the output.
///
/// It is applied to the landing voices only. The pops and the grind onset keep `CONTACT_TRIM`
/// alone, because their voice count did not change.
///
/// **Calibrated, in two measured passes.** A clipped peak reads as exactly 1.0 whatever is under
/// it, so the value could not be computed in one step:

/// the ceiling — not, as it first looked, that some other voice was responsible. `0.4 × 10^(−3.3
