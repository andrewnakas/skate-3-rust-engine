//! `CSTATEMGR_Collision` — the contact-sound subsystem `sub_82486EF0` posts to, and the sink the
//! grind onset and the continuous per-material impact level both need (`docs/engine-defects.md`
//! #9).
//!
//! Retail's audio is a three-level, data-driven object model (`docs/audio-object-registry.md`):
//! a `CSTATEMGR_<X>` manager owns N `CSTATE_<X>` slots, and each slot owns one `SFXObj_<Y>`
//! component. For collision, `CSTATEMGR_Collision::vtable[+8]` (`sub_824F17B8`) builds **exactly
//! ten** `CSTATE_Collision` slots on `[manager+16]`, each with one `SFXObj_Collision`.
//!
//! The delivery `sub_82486EF0` performs is two hops:
//!
//! 1. `[manager+668]->vtable[+12]` = `sub_824F1818`, a *router*: it walks the ten slots and keeps
//!    the one with the lowest signed `[node+64]`, calls that node's `vtable[+28]`
//!    (`sub_824F8B58`, which frees the message the slot was still holding) and returns it.
//! 2. that node's `vtable[+12]` = `sub_824F8990`, five instructions: stamp `[node+64]` from a
//!    global counter, park the message at `[node+68]`, activate the state.
//!
//! `[node+64]` being a *timestamp* is what makes the router an LRU: the slot that has gone
//! longest without a message is the one reused. [`CollisionStates`] is that manager.
//!
//! Two things come out of the component per frame:
//!
//! * `sub_824D1E00` (`SFXObj_Collision::vtable[+36]`) rewrites two controller inputs from zero
//!   every frame — a gate and a weight picked from the message's two tier words. That weight is
//!   retail's *continuous* landing dynamic, the part §9 of `player-audio-retail-drivers.md`
//!   identified as missing. See [`CollisionStates::drive`] and [`contact_weight`].
//! * `sub_824D1F68` starts up to two voices, one per material in the message, and `sub_824D2318`
//!   keeps their properties up to date. Which sample a material plays is read out of the
//!   controller's own outputs — `sub_824D20E8` and `sub_824D22B8` pick *which output id* from the
//!   material's category. See [`CollisionMaterials`].
//!
//! **The sample choice** is `sub_824965D0` → `sub_824967F8`, and it is a table, not code. The
//! image table at `0x8302D6E8` gives each material a *kind* word and the AttribSys key of its
//! record; the kind selects which family of fields on that record the sample comes from, and an
//! AttribSys field's retail type name **is** its bank — `Skate_Collisions` ->
//! `Skate_Collisions.bnk`, `Skate_Metal` -> `Skate_Metal.bnk`, `HOM_Set_1` -> `HOM_Set_1.bnk`.
//! Within a family, `(tier, the paired material's class)` picks the field. See [`KindFields`] and
//! [`CollisionMaterials::sample`].
//!
//! That is why a rail grind is two sounds and not one: the board's family base resolves out of
//! `Skate_Collisions.bnk` while the rail's own material resolves out of `Skate_Metal.bnk`.
//!
//! **One hole is left deliberately.** Kind 2's `tier == 0` against paired class 0 goes through
//! `sub_824825D0`, a different accessor that is not decoded, so that one combination resolves to
//! no sample rather than to a guess. Nothing here invents a sample.
