//! Playback of the game's own audio streams.
//!
//! The engine had no game audio at all: the only sounds were synthesized. This plays the real
//! thing, out of the retail archives, through the decode path in `skate-data`.
//!
//! Decoding is not cheap and it spawns an external process, so a request never runs on a schedule
//! thread. It goes to the async compute pool and the finished PCM is picked up on a later frame.
//! A stream that fails to decode is reported once and dropped rather than retried, because every
//! failure here is a property of the asset or the host's decoder and retrying would only repeat
//! the process spawn every frame.
//!
//! ## Verified by recording the sound card
//!
//! `skate3-audio-check` (`src/audio_check_main.rs`) runs this plugin with no window, renderer or
//! assets, so the audio path can be exercised on a checkout the game itself will not boot on.
//! Playing 60 blocks of the five-channel ambience bed through it, while recording the output
//! device's monitor:
//!
//! * the plugin decoded 306,816 frames of 5 channels (6.39 s) in 0.19 s and the stream ended
//!   after 6.6 s;
//! * the recorded level rose from about -58 dBFS before playback to about -45 dBFS during it;
//! * cross-correlating the decoded waveform against the recording peaks at **lag 1.370 s** --
//!   exactly the recorder's one-second head start plus this program's startup -- with a
//!   peak-to-mean ratio of **58.8**, against **5.7** for a time-reversed control whose peak lands
//!   at a lag outside the overlap.
//!
//! The absolute correlation is 0.22 rather than near 1 because the mixer downmixes five channels
//! to two and the device has its own response. The sharpness of the peak and the lag being right
//! are what carry the claim.
//!
//! ## What has been verified, and what has not
//!
//! The decode underneath this is checked byte-for-byte against an independently produced
//! reference on real archive data, and the logic in this file is unit-tested. But **no sound from
//! this path has been heard yet**: it was written on a checkout with no set-up asset pipeline, so
//! the game does not boot there to reach the startup hook. Treat the first run on a working
//! install as the real test, and start it with `SKATE_AUDIO_PLAY`.
