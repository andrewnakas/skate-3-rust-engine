//! Skate 3 audio: opening the retail containers and describing what is inside them.
//!
//! This is the engine-side half of the reverse-engineering in the sk8Audio repository. The
//! parsing lives in `skate-audio-formats` and the ported mixer graph in `skate-audio-core`;
//! this module is the seam between those and the game.
//!
//! **Where the boundary is, and why.** Containers parse here, in safe Rust, and a stream's
//! shape -- codec, rate, channels, block chain, chunk splits -- is fully described. What is
//! *not* here is XMA decoding: the retail audio is Xbox 360 XMA2, which the reference decoder
//! handles offline through FFmpeg (`tools/xma_decode.c` in sk8Audio). So this module hands out
//! descriptions and raw chunks, and a decoder is supplied by the caller through [`Decoder`].
//! That keeps the format work usable now and leaves the decoder swappable, which matters
//! because the one property being preserved across this whole effort is sample-exactness.
//!
//! Everything here operates on bytes the caller already owns. No file IO, so a mod or a test
//! can feed it a buffer from anywhere.
