//! Choosing an ambience bed for a place.
//!
//! `ambienceresident.big` holds 24 five-channel beds, each about two minutes, and **their member
//! names say where they belong**: a two-digit index, a district token, and a qualifier. Downtown
//! beds are `dt`, university `univ`, industrial `indu`, plus reclaimed land, interiors and the
//! start screen.
//!
//! ## This is a stand-in, and the difference matters
//!
//! The game does not choose beds by name. It chooses them through audio metadata that is **not
//! decoded** -- the banks in `audiofiles.big` and the mix map. What this module does is read the
//! names the archive already carries and match them against a place name, which is enough for the
//! engine to have ambience now and is **not** a reconstruction of what the game does. A bed picked
//! here may not be the bed Skate 3 would play in the same spot.
//!
//! So the rule is: match on evidence in the name, and when nothing matches, return `None` and play
//! nothing. Silence is a visible gap; a confidently wrong bed is not.

/// One bed, by the member name it has in the archive.
